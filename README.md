# Hangman Java
A Java console-only version of the popular game Hangman! Contains a customizable text file that holds all of the guessing words.

There is also a Title file which can be changed to display whatever message you would like (in ASCII characters) whenever you run the game.

You can choose to play the game solo, multiplayer (sharing the same keyboard), or vs. AI!

*Note, if you play multiplayer, you can choose how many players are playing. However, if there are more players than the length of the word, 
it is not guaranteed that everyone will get an equal chance to play. Therefore, it is best to play multiplayer with 2 people in total (Player vs Player)*
